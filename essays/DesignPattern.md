## Introduction

As a student in ICS 314 (Software Engineering) at UH Manoa, I’ve started to realize how useful design patterns really are. I first encountered them in my algorithms class, but back then, they seemed like these overly formal techniques that only applied to perfect-case scenarios. I didn’t see them as practical tools I could use in my own projects. But after working on more real-world coding tasks, I’ve come to see how patterns can make development feel more structured, manageable, and even enjoyable.

## Consistency That Helps the Whole Team

One of the biggest benefits of using design patterns is consistency. When a whole team follows the same structure, the codebase becomes easier to navigate. It’s like walking into a kitchen where everything’s labeled and organized—you don’t have to search too long to find what you need. Whether it's a new developer jumping into the code or me returning to an old file, familiar patterns make the experience smoother.

## Makes Projects More Maintainable, Not Just “Scalable”

People always talk about scalability, but for me, the real value in design patterns is maintainability. When I structure my code around a known pattern, I can revisit it weeks later and still understand what’s going on. As projects grow and features get added, patterns help keep everything from falling apart. They’re like the skeleton that holds the app together when it gets more complex.

## Saves Time (And Brainpower)

Using a familiar pattern means I don’t have to start from scratch every time. I already know what kind of structure might work, and that saves time and prevents mistakes—especially during high-pressure coding sessions like our WODs. Instead of second-guessing every architectural decision, I can lean on what I’ve seen work before.

## Reframing My Perspective: Final Thoughts

Looking back, I used to underestimate the usefulness of design patterns. I thought they were only for super advanced apps or very specific situations. But now, I see them as problem-solving shortcuts that help with everyday tasks. Whether I’m using React Context to clean up props or applying MVC to keep things separated, these patterns make my code easier to build and understand.

Even when I’m not consciously applying a specific pattern by name, I realize I’ve absorbed a lot of them into how I code. And when I see someone else’s work and recognize a familiar pattern, it gives me confidence to dive in and contribute. 

Design patterns aren’t just theory from a textbook—they’re tools that make me a better coder. I just wish I had started using them earlier.
