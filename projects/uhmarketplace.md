UH Marketplace is a University of Hawaii-exclusive alternative to Facebook Marketplace, made specifically for students to buy and sell items with other UH students. The app supports account creation, uploading new item posts, editing and deleting existing posts, as well as exploring all listings on the platform.

Some of the key features include:
- A working search bar that queries the database and displays matching listings.
- A favorites button that lets users save listings to their personal favorites tab.
- An explore page showcasing every post on the platform.
- Individual item pages with detailed descriptions and seller info.
- Profile pages that display all the posts made by a user, including the currently logged-in user.

### My Contributions
I acted as the **project manager**, organizing the full development timeline, assigning tasks based on each member's skill set, and ensuring all parts of the app worked together without breaking.

On the coding side:
- I built the **header**, **footer**, and the full **landing page** styling.
- I developed the **search functionality** which fetches listings from the database based on keywords and displays matching results.
- I created the reusable **item card component** used across the explore, favorites, and profile pages.
- I built the **profile pages**, both for the logged-in user and for accessing other users' profiles, which required secure user authentication and dynamic data fetching from the database.

This project helped me improve my project management skills, sharpen my ability to plan a feature roadmap, and strengthened my technical abilities in full-stack development using Supabase, Next.js, and React.
